Welcome to the ZEasyMath App for Android

This is an android app developed by Steven Dawson for his kids who were attending public school and had an awesome teacher who made them do rocket math.  The app is available on Google Play.

This program does not collect any personally identifiable information.  All data (app preferences, scores, progress etc.) created by you is stored on your device only and can be simpley erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any questions regarding how the app protects your privacy, lease send me an email and I will do my best to fix it / help you.

Yours Sincerely
Steven Dawson
